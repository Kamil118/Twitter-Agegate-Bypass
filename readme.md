This userscript uses FixTwtter API to bypass Twitter's new identity verification in UK and Europe. It automatically replaces the notification to confirm identity with the media url obtained through FixTwitter.

Limitations/Things I would like to add in the future

* Right now it detects the verification popup by searching for the english text. Would like to make it work for other languages
