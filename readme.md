This userscript uses FixTwtter API to bypass Twitter's new identity verification in UK and Europe. Upon pressing the hotkey (` by default), it will replace the notification to confirm identity with the media url obtained through FixTwitter.

Limitations/Things I would like to add in the future

* Right now it detects the verification popup by searching for the english text. Would like to make it work for other languages
